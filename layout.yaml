# Starting top left in the layout diagram, work anti-clockwise within
# each bunch of teams (they're in groups of 4 tables together),
# and either anti-clockwise around bunches of teams or left-to-right
# if they're in a line.
# While probably not entirely optimal, this should result in a fairly
# short path for someone needing to visit all teams.
#
# Location names aren't used, but make this file easier to update.
