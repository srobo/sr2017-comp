# Areas within the venue are allocated shepherds who operate only
# within that area. Each area is assigned a colour for easy
# identification by the shepherds on their various screens and print-outs.

# Note that these areas are also rendered on the shepherding layout
# printouts via an additional layer in the SVG. If either is updated,
# the other need to be kept in sync manually.
